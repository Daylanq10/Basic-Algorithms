  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>This Web application was created for the intent and purpose of helping others understand and study commonly occurring algorithms and their corresponding complexities that an early learning Computer Programmer can encounter.</p>
  <hr>
  <h1>Main Mission</h1>
  <p>Throughout all of the different programming languages, the one thing that remains consistent throughout is common ideas and how to implement these ideas. Algorithms are intended to show how to achieve certain tasks and are most generally shown in pseudocode, or a way of showing the logic of writing code without worrying about syntax errors.</p>

  <h1>Complexities</h1>
  <p>With memory growing at a large rate, Storage Complexity is not much of an issue anymore and will not be in focus when we address complexities in this web application. However, Time Complexity is an important factor. Time Complexity refers to the time it takes an algorithm to execute and is show as its worst case scenario. The form O(N) refers to the big-O which represents worst case, and N refers to one full iteration of which N is a variable of any size. The larger N is, the longer it will take for it to execute.</p>
