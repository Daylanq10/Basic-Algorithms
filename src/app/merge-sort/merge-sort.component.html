  <h1>Merge Sort</h1>
  <h4>This sorting algorithm follows the principle of divide and conquer. The list will be divided in half, the divided list will then be divided in half, this continues until the list is divided into individual items. These individual items are then merged back together piece by piece in the sorted order.</h4>
  <h1>Process</h1>
  <h4>1. Compare the first two items in the list, if they are not ordered, then swap their positions in the list.</h4>
  <h4>2. Move one index down the list and compare the next two items, again comparing and swapping if they are not in order.</h4>
  <h4>3. Continue down the list until all adjacent items have been compared.</h4>
  <h4>4. Repeat steps 1-3 until every compared items in the list are in the correct order</h4>
