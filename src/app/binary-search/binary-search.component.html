  <h1>Binary Search</h1>
  <h4>This search algorithm uses a divide and conquer approach and is a more efficient search that begins in the middle of the list and continually divides in the direction of the result until a result is found. This search algorithm requires a sorted list.  </h4>
  <h1>Process</h1>
  <h4>1. Split the original list in half.</h4>
  <h4>2. Continuously split the created sublist in half until each item is individualized.</h4>
  <h4>3. Merge each item together piece by piece by comparing them and placing the smallest items first.</h4>
